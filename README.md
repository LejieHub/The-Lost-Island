# 🏝️ The Lost Island - Unity VR Demo - CIM 423 Building Virtual Worlds

A Unity VR experience inspired by Minecraft and Unturned, blending exploration, sound feedback, and simple text-based choices in a low-poly world.

The story begins on a pirate ship caught in a storm, throwing the player overboard and onto a mysterious island. Through interactions like talking to a goblin on Mushroom Island, collecting skulls, and changing the skybox inside a tent, players unravel a quirky narrative. The experience ends in a credit scene after unlocking the final area.

Key elements:
- Unity terrain tools used to sculpt islands  
- Scene transitions based on player movement (falling into ocean triggers event)  
- Custom UI elements for title and end scene  
- Interactive objects with hover/select/activate states  
- Audio feedback and NPC dialogue to enhance immersion  

Built using Unity 6 and XR Interaction Toolkit.
