# 🏝️ The Lost Island - Unity VR Demo - CIM 423 Building Virtual Worlds

A Unity VR experience built with low-poly assets from the Unity Asset Store. Inspired by Minecraft and Unturned, this dramatic little island adventure mixes exploration, sound feedback, and simple text-based choices.

Players explore a whimsical world shaped by coconuts, treasure chests, skulls, and more—stitched together to form a strange but semi-logical narrative.

Key elements:
- Low-poly style for cohesive look
- Unity terrain tools used to sculpt islands
- Scene transitions based on player movement (falling into ocean triggers event)

Built using Unity 6 and XR Interaction Toolkit.
